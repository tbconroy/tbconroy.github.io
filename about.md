In love with test driven developement and honing his object oriented design skills. Lately has been working with Ruby on Rails. Has been known to spend significant time with JavaScript, which includes dabbling in Node and front-end frameworks like React. Wants to learn functional programing and for that reason has his eye on Elm.

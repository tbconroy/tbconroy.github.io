I hope to make this a place where I can flesh out my thoughts and understanding on certain topics in the world of tech and web development by writing about them. This will be a scratch pad of sorts for my ideas and opinions. It is not my intention to present myself as an authority on any topic, more like a mad scientist throwing out ideas and seeing what sticks. Because like everyone who makes a living in tech, the things that I do know are greatly outweighed by things I do not. This blog, I hope, will aid me in my journey to help close this gap, even if it is only in some small way.
